            <h1 className="aboutHead">About Gabby</h1>
            <p className="aboutBody">La Mexicana is a maker of salsas made with farm-fresh ingredients. We source our ingredients from farms that grow the freshest vegetables year ’round — firm sun-ripened tomatoes, crisp onion, zesty jalapeño, and fresh cilantro.

    Our farms are close to our kitchens, so when the crated veggies arrive, we work quickly to capture all the goodness, texture, and flavor. We chop, blend, season, and pack in 48 hours. This gives you a product that­’s perfect with chips or as an accompaniment to your favorite recipes.
