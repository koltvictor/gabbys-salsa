                <h3>How much does shipping cost?</h3>
                <p>We use USPS ground shipping services and the flatrate boxes.  A box holds 6 jars maximum, and each box costs $20.</p>
                <h3>Are Gabby's Salsas vegan?</h3>
                <p>Indeed!  All of Gabby's salsas are vegan, gluten-free, and made with organic ingredients.</p>
                <h3>How spicy are Gabby's Salsas?</h3>
                <p>Well, spice is subjective, but let's just say they aren't for the weak of heart.  Gabby does make a "Less Spicy" version of her salsas, but none of them are "mild".</p>
                <h3>Is there a store where I can buy Gabby's Salsas?</h3>
                <p>Nope!  Gabby makes small batches, so they're all individually made.  However, Gabby does have pop-ups from time-to-time, so be sure to get her newsletter so you can know where to find her!  Otherwise, just order here and get them delivered to your door.</p>
