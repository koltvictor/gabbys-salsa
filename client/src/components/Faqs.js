                <h3>How much does shipping cost?</h3>
                <p>We use USPS ground shipping services and the flatrate boxes.  A box holds 6 jars maximum, and each box costs $20.</p>
                <h3>Are Gabby's Salsas vegan?</h3>
                <p>Indeed!  All of Gabby's salsas are vegan, gluten-free, and made with organic ingredients.</p>
                <h3>How spicy are Gabby's Salsas?</h3>
                <p>Well, spice is subjective, but let's just say they aren't for the weak of heart.  Gabby does make a "Less Spicy" version of her salsas, but none of them are "mild".</p>
                <h3>Is there a store where I can buy Gabby's Salsas?</h3>
                <p>Nope!  Gabby makes small batches, so they're all individually made.  However, Gabby does have pop-ups from time-to-time, so be sure to get her newsletter so you can know where to find her!  Otherwise, just order here and get them delivered to your door.</p>
                <h3>What's the delivery time?</h3>
                <p>We use ground shipping, so depending on where you are it could be anytime up to about ten days.</p>
                <h3>How do I know it will still be fresh when it gets here?</h3>
                <p>Gabby uses dry ice and packs it around your jars, so you can expect the freshest salsa possible to be delivered to your door.</p>
